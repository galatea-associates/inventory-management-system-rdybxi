The architecture follows a microservices approach with event-driven communication through Kafka. The system is designed for high throughput with specialized components for different aspects of inventory management. The storage layer uses purpose-built databases for different data types, and the processing layer leverages in-memory data grid technology for low-latency calculations.

## 5. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### 5.1 HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

#### 5.1.1 System Overview

The Inventory Management System (IMS) follows an event-driven microservices architecture to achieve the high throughput, resilience, and flexibility required for real-time inventory calculations across global markets. This architectural approach was selected to address several key requirements:

- **Event-Driven Processing**: The system processes over 300,000 events per second with end-to-end latency under 200ms, requiring a highly optimized event processing pipeline.
- **Distributed Deployment**: Components can be deployed across geographic regions to minimize latency for market-specific operations while maintaining global data consistency.
- **Resilience and Redundancy**: The architecture supports partial failures without significant impact on user experience, achieving 99.999% uptime during operational hours.
- **Scalability**: The system scales horizontally to handle peak loads during market events and to accommodate the full universe of tradeable securities.

Key architectural principles include:

- **Domain-Driven Design**: The system is organized around business domains (data ingestion, calculation, workflow management) with clear boundaries.
- **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**: Separates read and write operations to optimize for high-throughput calculations and responsive queries.
- **Event Sourcing**: Maintains an immutable log of all events to ensure data integrity and support audit requirements.
- **Polyglot Persistence**: Utilizes specialized databases for different data types (time-series, relational, in-memory) to optimize performance.

System boundaries encompass data ingestion from external sources, internal processing and calculations, and distribution to downstream systems and user interfaces. Major interfaces include REST APIs, WebSocket connections for real-time updates, and message-based integration with external systems.

#### 5.1.2 Core Components Table

| Component Name | Primary Responsibility | Key Dependencies | Critical Considerations |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data Ingestion Services | Receive and normalize data from external sources | External data providers, Data mapping engine | Must handle diverse data formats and ensure data quality |
| Data Mapping Engine | Transform external identifiers to internal schema | Reference data store | Must resolve conflicts and maintain data lineage |
| Calculation Engine | Perform inventory calculations | Position data, Market data, Reference data | Must achieve sub-200ms performance for all calculations |
| Position Service | Maintain real-time position data | Trade data, Settlement data | Must handle high-frequency updates |
| Inventory Service | Calculate availability across different categories | Position data, Market rules | Must support market-specific rule customization |
| Workflow Engine | Manage locate and short sell approval processes | Inventory data, Client limits | Must complete workflows within SLA (150ms for short sell) |
| Message Bus | Facilitate asynchronous communication between services | None | Must guarantee message delivery with at-least-once semantics |
| API Gateway | Provide unified access point for external systems | All internal services | Must enforce security and handle high request volumes |
| User Interface | Present data and workflows to end users | API Gateway | Must support responsive visualization of large datasets |

#### 5.1.3 Data Flow Description

The IMS data flow begins with parallel ingestion streams for reference data, market data, trade data, and contract data. Each ingestion service validates and normalizes incoming data before publishing events to the central message bus.

The message bus serves as the backbone of the system, implementing a publish-subscribe pattern that allows services to consume only relevant events. This approach decouples services and enables independent scaling. The message bus guarantees at-least-once delivery with deduplication mechanisms to handle potential duplicates.

Position and inventory calculations are triggered by relevant events. The calculation engine maintains in-memory state for high-performance processing while persisting results to appropriate data stores. Calculation results are published back to the message bus for consumption by other services and downstream systems.

Workflow processes for locate approvals and short sell validations consume position and inventory data to make decisions. These workflows may involve automated rules processing or manual intervention through the user interface.

Data is persisted in specialized stores:
- Reference data in a relational database
- Market data in a time-series database
- Position data in a distributed NoSQL database
- Calculation results in an in-memory data grid with persistence

The API layer provides access to data and functionality for both the user interface and external systems. Real-time updates are delivered via WebSocket connections, while request-response interactions use REST APIs.

### 5.3 TECHNICAL DECISIONS

#### 5.3.1 Architecture Style Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Selected Approach | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Overall Architecture | Monolithic, Microservices, Service-Oriented | Event-Driven Microservices | Enables high throughput, independent scaling, and resilience required for real-time processing |
| Communication Pattern | Request-Response, Event-Driven, Hybrid | Event-Driven with Request-Response for queries | Supports high-throughput asynchronous processing while allowing direct queries for UI |
| State Management | Stateful Services, Stateless with External State, Hybrid | Stateless services with distributed state | Enables horizontal scaling while maintaining performance for stateful operations |
| Deployment Model | Centralized, Regional, Hybrid | Hybrid with core services global and edge services regional | Balances global consistency with regional performance requirements |

The event-driven microservices architecture was selected primarily to address the high-throughput requirement (300,000+ events per second) while maintaining sub-200ms end-to-end latency. This approach allows for:

- Independent scaling of components based on load
- Resilience through service isolation
- Flexibility in deployment across geographic regions
- Optimized data processing pipelines for different data types

The hybrid communication pattern combines event-driven processing for high-throughput operations with request-response for user queries, providing the best of both worlds for different use cases.

    I --> J
    
    J -->|Stateful| K[Vertical Scaling]
    J -->|Stateless| L[Horizontal Scaling]
    J -->|Mixed| M[Distributed State]
```

#### 5.3.2 Data Storage Solution Rationale

| Data Type | Selected Solution | Alternatives Considered | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reference Data | PostgreSQL | MongoDB, Oracle | Strong consistency, complex relationships, ACID compliance |
| Market Data | InfluxDB/TimescaleDB | Cassandra, KDB+ | Optimized for time-series data with high write throughput |
| Position Data | Cassandra | MongoDB, CockroachDB | Horizontal scalability, tunable consistency, optimized for writes |
| Calculation Results | Hazelcast + Redis | Memcached, Coherence | In-memory performance with persistence, distributed processing |

The polyglot persistence approach was selected to optimize each data store for its specific use case:

- Reference data requires strong consistency and complex relationship modeling, making PostgreSQL ideal
- Market data has high write throughput with time-series access patterns, making specialized time-series databases optimal
- Position data requires horizontal scalability with eventual consistency, making Cassandra a strong choice
- Calculation results need sub-millisecond access with distributed processing capabilities, making in-memory data grids with persistence the best option

This approach prioritizes performance and scalability over the simplicity of a single database solution, which is necessary given the performance requirements of the system.

#### 5.3.3 Caching Strategy Justification

| Cache Type | Implementation | Purpose | Eviction Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reference Data Cache | Hazelcast Near Cache | Minimize database reads for static data | Time-based with updates on change |
| Calculation Result Cache | Redis | Store recent calculation results | LRU with time-based expiration |
| Position Data Cache | Hazelcast | Maintain active positions for calculations | None (complete dataset) |
| API Response Cache | Redis | Reduce duplicate query processing | Time-based with invalidation on updates |

The multi-level caching strategy is designed to:

- Minimize latency for frequently accessed data
- Reduce database load for read-heavy operations
- Maintain data consistency through appropriate invalidation
- Support distributed access across services

For calculation-intensive operations, the system maintains an in-memory representation of all active positions to eliminate database reads during the calculation process. This approach is critical for achieving the sub-200ms latency requirement for end-to-end processing.

### 5.4 CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS

#### 5.4.1 Monitoring and Observability Approach

The IMS implements a comprehensive monitoring and observability strategy with multiple layers:

- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Kubernetes-native monitoring for cluster health, resource utilization, and node status
- **Application Metrics**: Custom and standard JVM metrics collected via Micrometer and exposed through Prometheus endpoints
- **Business Metrics**: Domain-specific metrics for inventory levels, calculation performance, and workflow throughput
- **Distributed Tracing**: End-to-end request tracing using OpenTelemetry to track requests across service boundaries
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with structured log formats and correlation IDs using the ELK stack
- **Alerting**: Multi-level alerting based on SLOs with different severity levels and notification channels
- **Dashboards**: Custom Grafana dashboards for both technical and business metrics

Key monitoring metrics include:
- End-to-end latency for event processing
- Throughput rates for different event types
- Error rates and types
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- Database query performance
- API response times
- Business-level metrics (inventory levels, locate approval rates)

#### 5.4.2 Error Handling Patterns

The IMS implements a multi-layered error handling strategy:

- **Validation Errors**: Detected during data ingestion and returned immediately with clear error messages
- **Business Rule Violations**: Handled through defined exception flows with appropriate notifications
- **System Failures**: Managed through circuit breakers, retries, and fallback mechanisms
- **Integration Failures**: Isolated through bulkheads to prevent cascading failures

All errors are logged with correlation IDs to enable tracing through the system. Critical errors trigger alerts to operations teams, while business exceptions are routed to appropriate business users for resolution.

    G --> R[Complete Error Handling]
    K --> R
    M --> R
    O --> R
    P --> R
    Q --> R
```

#### 5.4.3 Authentication and Authorization Framework

The IMS implements a comprehensive security framework:

- **Authentication**: OAuth2/OpenID Connect integration with the bank's identity provider
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
- **API Security**: TLS encryption, API keys, and JWT tokens
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Audit**: Comprehensive audit logging of all security-relevant events

User roles are defined based on business functions (trader, operations, compliance) with appropriate permissions for each role. The system supports delegation of authority and temporary access grants for specific functions.

All security events are logged and monitored for suspicious activity, with alerts for potential security violations. Regular security audits and penetration testing ensure the ongoing security of the system.

#### 5.4.4 Performance Requirements and SLAs

| Component | Performance Metric | SLA Target | Measurement Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Event Processing | End-to-end Latency | <200ms (P99) | Distributed Tracing |
| Short Sell Approval | Response Time | <150ms (P99) | API Metrics |
| UI Dashboard | Load Time | <3s (P95) | Browser Metrics |
| Calculation Engine | Throughput | >300,000 events/sec | System Metrics |
| System Availability | Uptime | 99.999% during 24x6 hours | Uptime Monitoring |

Performance testing is conducted regularly using production-like data volumes to ensure the system meets these requirements. Automated performance regression testing is part of the CI/CD pipeline to catch performance degradation early.

The system is designed with headroom to handle peak loads during market events, with auto-scaling capabilities to add resources during high-demand periods. Performance bottlenecks are continuously monitored and addressed through optimization efforts.

#### 5.4.5 Disaster Recovery Procedures

The IMS implements a comprehensive disaster recovery strategy:

- **Data Backup**: Regular backups of all persistent data with point-in-time recovery capabilities
- **System Redundancy**: Multi-region deployment with active-active configuration
- **Recovery Automation**: Automated recovery procedures for common failure scenarios
- **Failover Testing**: Regular testing of failover capabilities to ensure effectiveness
- **Business Continuity**: Defined procedures for operating during system degradation

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is set at 15 minutes for critical functions, with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) of less than 1 minute for transaction data. Non-critical functions have longer RTOs based on business impact.

Disaster recovery procedures are documented, regularly tested, and updated based on lessons learned from tests and actual incidents. The system includes capabilities for partial operation during recovery, prioritizing critical business functions.

#### 6.1.3 Component Interactions

The system follows an event-driven architecture with the Message Bus serving as the central communication mechanism between components. Key interaction patterns include:

1. **Data Ingestion Flow**:
   - External data sources → API Gateway → Data Services → Data Mapping Engine → Message Bus
   - Data Services persist normalized data to appropriate data stores

2. **Calculation Flow**:
   - Message Bus → Event Processing → Calculation Engine → Message Bus
   - Calculation Service persists calculation results to Calculation Results store

3. **Workflow Flow**:
   - API Gateway → Workflow Service → Rule Engine → Message Bus
   - Workflow Service orchestrates multi-step processes like locate approvals

4. **Query Flow**:
   - API Gateway → Appropriate Service → Data Store → Response to client

The event-driven approach enables loose coupling between components, allowing them to evolve independently and scale based on their specific workload characteristics.

### 6.2 DATA SERVICES DESIGN

#### 6.2.1 Reference Data Service

**Purpose**: Manage all reference data including securities, counterparties, indexes, and aggregation units.

**Key Functions**:
- Process weekly batch loads of security reference data
- Handle real-time reference data updates
- Reconcile and merge data from multiple sources
- Maintain internal identifier mapping
- Report conflicts in security mapping

**Data Model**:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Security {
        string internalId PK
        string securityType
        string issuer
        date issueDate
        date maturityDate
        string currency
        string status
        string market
        int version
    }
    
    SecurityIdentifier {
        string internalSecurityId FK
        string identifierType
        string identifierValue
        string source
    }
    
    Counterparty {
        string counterpartyId PK
        string name
        string type
        string kycStatus
        string status
    }
    
    CounterpartyIdentifier {
        string counterpartyId FK
        string identifierType
        string identifierValue
    }
    
    CounterpartyRelationship {
        string parentId FK
        string childId FK
        string relationshipType
    }
    
    IndexComposition {
        string indexId FK
        string constituentId FK
        float weight
        string compositionType
        date effectiveDate
    }
    
    AggregationUnit {
        string aggregationUnitId PK
        string name
        string type
        string market
        string officerId FK
    }
    
    Security ||--o{ SecurityIdentifier : "has"
    Counterparty ||--o{ CounterpartyIdentifier : "has"
    Counterparty ||--o{ CounterpartyRelationship : "has parent"
    Counterparty ||--o{ CounterpartyRelationship : "has child"
    Security ||--o{ IndexComposition : "is index"
    Security ||--o{ IndexComposition : "is constituent"
```

**Processing Logic**:

1. **Batch Processing**:
   - Receive batch file from data provider
   - Parse and validate file format
   - For each security record:
     - Check if security exists in system
     - If exists, compare attributes for changes
     - If changed, update record and increment version
     - If new, create record with version 1
   - Generate reconciliation report

2. **Real-time Updates**:
   - Receive update event
   - Validate event format
   - Map external identifiers to internal identifier
   - Update security record and increment version
   - Publish reference data change event

3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - Identify conflicting mappings between data sources
   - Apply resolution rules based on source priority
   - If automatic resolution not possible, create exception

     - Subtract approved long sell orders
   - For short sell:
     - Sum approved locates
     - Add approved short sell pay-to-holds
     - Subtract approved short sell orders

3. **Aggregation Unit Limit Calculation**:
   - For long sell:
     - Sum existing long positions
   - For short sell:
     - Sum existing borrow contracts
     - Subtract existing loan contracts
     - Add external lender availabilities where permitted

4. **Order Approval Processing**:
   - Check order quantity against client limit
   - If sufficient, check against aggregation unit limit
   - If both checks pass, approve order
   - Otherwise, reject order with appropriate reason

5. **Limit Update**:
   - For approved orders:
     - Update client limit
     - Update aggregation unit limit
   - Return approval response

**Performance Considerations**:
- In-memory caching of client and AU limits
- Optimized limit calculation for high-frequency updates
- Parallel processing of multiple order validations
- Maximum 150ms end-to-end processing time

#### 6.5.4 UI Performance Considerations

To ensure responsive user experience with large datasets, the UI implements several performance optimization techniques:

1. **Virtualized Lists and Tables**:
   - Only render visible rows in large data grids
   - Implement windowing for smooth scrolling
   - Lazy load data as user scrolls

2. **Data Loading Strategies**:
   - Progressive loading of dashboard components
   - Prioritize critical data first
   - Background loading of supplementary data
   - Skeleton screens during loading

3. **State Management Optimization**:
   - Selective updates to avoid full re-renders
   - Memoization of expensive calculations
   - Optimized Redux selectors
   - Local component state for UI-only state

4. **Network Optimization**:
   - GraphQL for precise data fetching
   - Data compression
   - Request batching
   - Optimistic UI updates

5. **Rendering Optimization**:
   - Code splitting for smaller initial load

## 6.1 CORE SERVICES ARCHITECTURE

### 6.1.1 SERVICE COMPONENTS

The Inventory Management System (IMS) employs a microservices architecture to achieve the high throughput, resilience, and flexibility required for real-time inventory calculations across global markets.

#### Service Boundaries and Responsibilities

| Service Group | Component Services | Primary Responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Ingestion Services | Reference Data Service<br>Market Data Service<br>Trade Data Service<br>Contract Service | Consume and normalize data from external sources<br>Validate data format and content<br>Transform data to internal schema<br>Publish normalized data events |
| Calculation Services | Position Service<br>Inventory Service<br>Limit Service<br>Projection Service | Calculate real-time positions<br>Determine inventory availability<br>Calculate client and AU limits<br>Project future positions and inventory |
| Workflow Services | Locate Service<br>Short Sell Service<br>Rule Engine Service | Process locate requests<br>Validate short sell orders<br>Apply business rules for approvals |
| API Services | REST API Gateway<br>WebSocket Service<br>GraphQL Service | Provide external access to system<br>Support real-time data streaming<br>Enable complex data queries |

#### Inter-Service Communication Patterns

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Communication Patterns"
        direction LR
        A[Event-Driven] --> B[Message Bus]
        C[Request-Response] --> D[API Gateway]
        E[Streaming] --> F[WebSocket]
    end
    
    subgraph "Message Types"
        G[Domain Events]
        H[Commands]
        I[Queries]
        J[Notifications]
    end
    
    B --> G
    B --> H
    D --> I
    F --> J
```

The IMS implements multiple communication patterns:

1. **Event-Driven Communication**: Primary pattern for high-throughput data processing
   - Uses Apache Kafka as the central message bus
   - Guarantees at-least-once delivery with deduplication
   - Supports event sourcing for audit and replay capabilities

2. **Request-Response**: Used for synchronous operations and queries
   - REST APIs for standard operations
   - GraphQL for complex data queries
   - gRPC for high-performance internal service communication

3. **Streaming**: Used for real-time data distribution
   - WebSocket connections for UI updates
   - Server-Sent Events for one-way notifications
   - Kafka Streams for continuous data processing

#### Service Discovery Mechanisms

The IMS employs a hybrid service discovery approach:

1. **Client-Side Discovery**: Services discover each other directly
   - Service registry maintained in Consul
   - Health checks performed by Consul
   - Service instances register on startup and deregister on shutdown

2. **Server-Side Discovery**: API Gateway routes requests to appropriate services
   - Load balancer integrated with service registry
   - Dynamic routing based on service health and availability
   - Circuit breaker integration for fault tolerance

#### Load Balancing Strategy

| Load Balancing Level | Mechanism | Strategy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Infrastructure | Kubernetes Service | Round-robin with readiness probes |
| Application | Custom Load Balancer | Weighted round-robin based on capacity |
| Regional | Global Load Balancer | Geo-proximity routing with failover |
| Message Bus | Kafka Consumer Groups | Partition-based distribution |

The system implements a multi-level load balancing strategy:

1. **Infrastructure Level**: Kubernetes-native load balancing for containerized services
2. **Application Level**: Custom load balancing for specialized workloads
3. **Regional Level**: Global load balancing for geographic distribution
4. **Message Bus Level**: Partition-based load balancing for event consumers

#### Circuit Breaker Patterns

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Closed
    Closed --> Open: Failure Threshold Exceeded
    Open --> HalfOpen: Timeout Period Elapsed
    HalfOpen --> Closed: Success Threshold Met
    HalfOpen --> Open: Failure Occurs
```

The IMS implements circuit breakers using Resilience4j with the following configuration:

1. **Failure Thresholds**: Circuit opens after 5 consecutive failures
2. **Timeout Period**: Circuit remains open for 30 seconds before attempting recovery
3. **Half-Open State**: Allows limited traffic to test service recovery
4. **Success Threshold**: Circuit fully closes after 3 consecutive successful operations
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Each service defines appropriate fallbacks for circuit open states

#### Retry and Fallback Mechanisms

| Scenario | Retry Strategy | Fallback Mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transient Network Issues | Exponential backoff with jitter | Use cached data if available |
| Service Unavailability | Limited retries with circuit breaker | Degrade service functionality |
| Database Timeouts | Immediate retry with timeout increase | Use read replicas or cached data |
| Message Delivery Failures | Dead letter queue with reprocessing | Manual intervention queue |

The system implements sophisticated retry and fallback mechanisms:

1. **Retry Strategies**:
   - Exponential backoff with jitter to prevent thundering herd
   - Retry budgets to limit system-wide retry load
   - Retry policies customized by operation type

2. **Fallback Mechanisms**:
   - Cached data for read operations
   - Degraded functionality for non-critical features
   - Asynchronous processing for delayed operations
   - Manual intervention queues for critical failures

### 6.1.2 SCALABILITY DESIGN

#### Horizontal/Vertical Scaling Approach

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph "Scaling Strategy"
        A[Service Type] --> B{Scaling Approach}
        B -->|Stateless Services| C[Horizontal Scaling]
        B -->|Stateful Services| D[Vertical Scaling + Sharding]
        B -->|Computation-Intensive| E[Hybrid Scaling]
        
        C --> F[Kubernetes HPA]
        D --> G[Database Sharding]
        E --> H[GPU Acceleration]
    end
```

The IMS implements a hybrid scaling approach:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**:
   - Stateless services scale horizontally via Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
   - Event processors scale by adding consumer instances to consumer groups
   - API services scale based on request volume

2. **Vertical Scaling**:
   - Calculation engines scale vertically for memory-intensive operations
   - Database instances scale vertically for I/O-intensive workloads
   - In-memory data grids scale vertically for low-latency access

3. **Data Sharding**:
   - Position data sharded by security identifier
   - Market data sharded by data source and time range
   - Calculation results sharded by calculation type and security

#### Auto-Scaling Triggers and Rules

| Service Type | Scaling Metric | Scale-Out Trigger | Scale-In Trigger | Cooldown Period |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |  --- |
| API Services | CPU Utilization | >70% for 3 minutes | <30% for 10 minutes | 5 minutes |
| Event Processors | Consumer Lag | >1000 messages for 2 minutes | <100 messages for 10 minutes | 3 minutes |
| Calculation Services | Memory Utilization | >75% for 2 minutes | <40% for 15 minutes | 10 minutes |
| Database Services | Connection Count | >80% of max for 5 minutes | <40% of max for 30 minutes | 15 minutes |

Auto-scaling is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Infrastructure Level**:
   - Kubernetes HPA based on CPU, memory, and custom metrics
   - Node auto-scaling based on cluster-wide resource utilization

2. **Application Level**:
   - Dynamic thread pool sizing based on workload
   - Adaptive batch sizes for processing efficiency
   - On-demand calculation resource allocation

3. **Data Store Level**:
   - Read replica auto-scaling based on query volume
   - Cache size adjustment based on hit/miss ratios
   - Time-series database partition management

#### Resource Allocation Strategy

The IMS implements a resource allocation strategy that prioritizes critical services:

1. **Resource Quotas**:
   - Guaranteed resources for critical services
   - Burstable resources for variable workloads
   - Resource limits to prevent noisy neighbor issues

2. **Priority Classes**:
   - High priority for core calculation services
   - Medium priority for data ingestion services
   - Low priority for batch processing and analytics

3. **Resource Optimization**:
   - Right-sizing based on historical utilization
   - Vertical pod autoscaling for efficient resource use
   - Spot instances for non-critical workloads

#### Performance Optimization Techniques

| Component | Optimization Technique | Expected Improvement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Data Ingestion | Batch processing with adaptive sizing | 3-5x throughput increase |
| Calculation Engine | In-memory processing with vectorization | 10-20x calculation speed |
| Database Access | Connection pooling and query optimization | 50-70% latency reduction |
| API Responses | Response caching with invalidation | 80-90% reduced load for repeated queries |

The system employs multiple performance optimization techniques:

1. **Data Processing Optimizations**:
   - Batch processing for high-volume data
   - Data locality for reduced network transfer
   - Parallel processing for independent calculations
   - Incremental processing for position updates

2. **Memory Optimizations**:
   - Off-heap memory for large datasets

The IMS implements a multi-level caching strategy to minimize database load:

**Cache Hierarchy**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Client[Client] --> L1[Browser Cache]
    L1 --> API[API Gateway]
    API --> L2[API Response Cache]
    L2 --> Service[Service Layer]
    Service --> L3[Application Cache]
    L3 --> DB[Database]
    
    subgraph "Cache Types by Data"
        C1[Reference Data - Long TTL]
        C2[Position Data - Short TTL]
        C3[Calculation Results - Very Short TTL]
        C4[Query Results - Adaptive TTL]
    end
```

**Cache Implementation Details**

| Cache Type | Implementation | Data Types | Eviction Policy | Size Limit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 Browser | Browser Storage | UI Components, Static Data | LRU, TTL | Client-dependent |
| L2 API | Redis | API Responses | TTL, Event-based | 10GB |
| L3 Application | Hazelcast | Reference Data, Calculations | TTL, LRU | 100GB |
| Database | Database Buffer | Frequently Accessed Data | LRU | 200GB |

**Cache Synchronization**

1. **Write-Through**: Updates propagate to cache immediately
2. **Write-Behind**: Updates batched for efficiency
3. **Cache-Aside**: Cache populated on read
4. **Event-Based Invalidation**: Cache entries invalidated on data changes

#### Connection Pooling

The IMS implements optimized connection pooling to maximize database throughput:

**Connection Pool Configuration**

| Database Type | Min Connections | Max Connections | Idle Timeout | Max Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL | 10 per service | 100 per service | 10 minutes | 30 minutes |
| TimescaleDB | 5 per service | 50 per service | 5 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Cassandra | 20 per service | 200 per service | 15 minutes | 60 minutes |
| Redis | 5 per service | 50 per service | 5 minutes | 30 minutes |

**Connection Management Strategies**

1. **Pool Sizing**
   - Dynamic sizing based on load
   - Separate pools for read and write
   - Service-specific pool configuration

2. **Connection Validation**
   - Pre-borrow validation
   - Idle connection testing
   - Stale connection detection

3. **Connection Metrics**
   - Pool utilization monitoring
   - Wait time tracking
   - Connection lifetime analysis

#### Read/Write Splitting

The IMS implements read/write splitting to optimize database performance:

**Read/Write Architecture**

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    App[Application] --> Router[Query Router]
    Router -->|Writes| Master[Master Database]
    Router -->|Reads| ReadReplica1[Read Replica 1]
    Router -->|Reads| ReadReplica2[Read Replica 2]
    Router -->|Reads| ReadReplica3[Read Replica 3]
    
    Master -->|Replication| ReadReplica1
    Master -->|Replication| ReadReplica2
    Master -->|Replication| ReadReplica3
    
    subgraph "Routing Rules"
        R1[Write Operations]
        R2[Read-after-Write]
        R3[Reporting Queries]
        R4[Real-time Queries]
    end
```

**Splitting Implementation**

| Query Type | Routing Destination | Consistency Requirement | Latency Tolerance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Writes | Master | Strong | Low |
| Read-after-Write | Master | Strong | Low |
| Real-time Queries | Read Replica (Low Lag) | Eventually Consistent | Medium |
| Reporting Queries | Read Replica (Any) | Eventually Consistent | High |

**Consistency Management**

1. **Session Consistency**
   - Track writes in session
   - Route reads to master after write
   - Timeout-based fallback to replicas

2. **Lag Monitoring**
   - Replication lag measurement
   - Adaptive routing based on lag
   - Circuit breaking for high-lag scenarios

3. **Stale Data Handling**
   - Version-based cache invalidation
   - Timestamp-based freshness check
   - Client-side staleness indicators

#### Batch Processing Approach

The IMS implements efficient batch processing for high-volume operations:

**Batch Processing Patterns**

1. **Ingestion Batching**
   - Variable-sized batches based on throughput
   - Parallel processing of independent batches
   - Checkpointing for resumable processing

2. **Update Batching**
   - Bulk updates for efficiency
   - Optimistic locking for concurrency
   - Transactional boundaries for consistency

3. **Query Batching**
   - Multi-get operations for related data
   - Bulk loading for reference data
   - Pagination for large result sets

**Batch Size Optimization**

| Operation Type | Optimal Batch Size | Processing Strategy | Error Handling |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reference Data Load | 10,000 records | Parallel processing | Continue with errors |
| Position Updates | 1,000 records | Sequential processing | Rollback batch |
| Market Data Ingestion | 5,000 records | Parallel processing | Skip and log |
| Calculation Processing | 500 securities | Parallel processing | Retry individual |

## 6.3 INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE

### 6.3.1 API DESIGN

The Inventory Management System (IMS) requires extensive integration with multiple external systems to ingest data, process calculations, and distribute results. The API design follows a comprehensive approach to ensure secure, reliable, and high-performance integration.

#### Protocol Specifications

| Protocol | Usage | Characteristics | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST | Primary API protocol | Resource-oriented, stateless | JSON over HTTPS with HAL hypermedia |
| WebSocket | Real-time data streaming | Bi-directional, persistent | Binary and JSON message formats |
| FIX/FAST | Market data integration | High-performance, binary | Standard FIX 5.0 SP2 with FAST encoding |
| gRPC | Internal service communication | High-throughput, binary | Protocol Buffers with streaming support |

The IMS implements a multi-protocol approach to address different integration needs:

- REST APIs for standard request-response interactions
- WebSockets for real-time data streaming to UIs and downstream systems
- FIX/FAST for high-volume market data ingestion
- gRPC for internal service-to-service communication requiring high performance

```mermaid

    subgraph "External Systems"
        A[Trading Systems]
        B[Market Data Providers]
        C[Reference Data Systems]

    E --> I
    F --> I
    G --> J
    H --> J
    
    I --> K
    J --> K
```

#### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Case | Implementation | Token Lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OAuth 2.0 | User authentication | JWT with OpenID Connect | 1 hour access, 24 hour refresh |
| mTLS | System-to-system | X.509 certificates | 90 days |
| API Keys | External partners | HMAC-signed requests | 180 days |
| SAML 2.0 | Enterprise SSO | Federation with corporate IdP | Session-based |

The authentication strategy employs multiple methods based on the integration context:

1. **User Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 with JWT tokens for web and mobile applications
2. **Service Authentication**: Mutual TLS for secure service-to-service communication
3. **Partner Integration**: API keys with HMAC request signing for external partners
4. **Enterprise Integration**: SAML 2.0 for integration with corporate identity providers

All authentication methods support multi-factor authentication where appropriate and implement certificate rotation procedures to maintain security.

#### Authorization Framework

The IMS implements a comprehensive authorization framework based on:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Predefined roles (Trader, Operations, Compliance, Admin)
   - Role assignment to users and systems
   - Role hierarchy with inheritance

2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**:
   - Dynamic permissions based on attributes
   - Context-aware authorization (time, location, device)
   - Fine-grained access control for specific resources

3. **Resource-Level Permissions**:
   - Read/write/execute permissions
   - Resource ownership and delegation
   - Temporal access restrictions

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Gateway as API Gateway
    participant Auth as Authorization Service
    participant Service as Backend Service
    
    Client->>Gateway: Request with JWT
    Gateway->>Auth: Validate Token & Permissions
    
    alt Authorized
        Auth->>Gateway: Authorization Granted
        Gateway->>Service: Forward Request
        Service->>Gateway: Process Request
        Gateway->>Client: Return Response
    else Unauthorized
        Auth->>Gateway: Authorization Denied
        Gateway->>Client: 403 Forbidden
    end
```

#### Rate Limiting Strategy

| Tier | Rate Limit | Burst Allowance | Throttling Response |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Critical Services | 10,000 req/min | 200% for 30 seconds | 429 with retry-after |
| Standard Services | 1,000 req/min | 150% for 60 seconds | 429 with retry-after |
| Batch Operations | 100 req/min | 300% for 5 minutes | Queue with callback |
| Public APIs | 60 req/min | None | 429 with retry-after |

The rate limiting implementation includes:

1. **Multi-level Rate Limiting**:
   - Global limits to protect overall system resources
   - Service-specific limits based on capacity
   - User/client-specific limits based on tier

2. **Adaptive Rate Limiting**:
   - Dynamic adjustment based on system load
   - Circuit breaking for degraded services
   - Quota-based limiting for batch operations

3. **Rate Limit Headers**:
   - `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
   - `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in window
   - `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time until limit resets

#### Versioning Approach

The IMS API versioning strategy follows these principles:

1. **URI Path Versioning**:
   - Major version in URI path: `/api/v1/positions`
   - Ensures clear separation between incompatible versions

2. **Semantic Versioning**:
   - Major version: Breaking changes
   - Minor version: Backward-compatible additions
   - Patch version: Bug fixes and non-functional changes

3. **Version Lifecycle**:
   - Development: Early access for testing
   - Active: Fully supported version
   - Deprecated: Scheduled for removal (6-month notice)
   - Sunset: No longer available

4. **Compatibility Guidelines**:
   - Backward compatibility within major versions
   - No removal of fields without version change
   - New optional fields can be added in minor versions
   - Field meaning cannot change without major version

#### Documentation Standards

| Documentation Type | Format | Audience | Update Frequency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Reference | OpenAPI 3.0 | Developers | With each release |
| Integration Guide | Markdown | System Integrators | Monthly |
| Tutorials | Markdown + Examples | New Developers | Quarterly |

### 6.3.2 MESSAGE PROCESSING

#### Event Processing Patterns

The IMS implements several event processing patterns to handle the high volume and variety of events:

1. **Event Sourcing**:
   - All state changes captured as immutable events
   - Event log as the source of truth
   - State reconstruction from event sequence
   - Support for audit and compliance requirements

2. **Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)**:
   - Separate write and read models
   - Optimized command processing for writes
   - Specialized query models for different read patterns
   - Eventual consistency between models

3. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
   - Loose coupling through event publication
   - Reactive processing based on event triggers
   - Parallel processing of independent events
   - Scalable event processing pipelines

```mermaid

    I --> M[Event Store]
    J --> M
    K --> M
    L --> M
```

#### Message Queue Architecture

The IMS utilizes a sophisticated message queue architecture to handle the high throughput requirements:

1. **Message Broker Selection**:
   - Apache Kafka as the primary message broker
   - RabbitMQ for specific workflow queues
   - Redis Streams for low-latency requirements

2. **Topic/Queue Design**:
   - Domain-oriented topics (trades, positions, market data)
   - Partitioning by security ID for parallelism
   - Compacted topics for reference data
   - Dead letter queues for failed messages

3. **Message Delivery Guarantees**:
   - At-least-once delivery semantics

    D --> E
    E --> F
    F <--> G
    
    F --> H
    F --> I
    F --> J
```

        alt Valid Data
            Validator->>Processor: Validation Passed
            Processor->>Processor: Transform Data
            Processor->>Target: Store Processed Data
            Processor->>Stream: Publish Change Events
        else Invalid Data
            Validator->>Processor: Validation Failed
            Processor->>Processor: Log Errors
        end
    end
    
    Processor->>Target: Finalize Batch
    Processor->>Source: Acknowledge Completion
```

#### Error Handling Strategy

The IMS implements a comprehensive error handling strategy across all integration points:

1. **Error Categorization**:
   - Transient errors (network issues, timeouts)

## 6.4 SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

The Inventory Management System (IMS) requires a comprehensive security architecture to protect sensitive financial data, ensure regulatory compliance across global jurisdictions, and maintain the integrity of inventory calculations. This section outlines the security controls, frameworks, and mechanisms implemented throughout the system.

### 6.4.1 AUTHENTICATION FRAMEWORK

#### Identity Management

The IMS implements a robust identity management system integrated with the bank's enterprise identity infrastructure:

| Component | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Identity Provider | Integration with corporate Okta/Azure AD | Centralized identity management |
| Service Accounts | Dedicated managed identities | System-to-system authentication |
| External Partner Identities | Federated identity with B2B partners | Secure partner integration |
| Directory Synchronization | Real-time sync with HR systems | Automated user provisioning/deprovisioning |

User identities are managed through a lifecycle process that includes:
- Automated provisioning based on HR and role assignment systems
- Regular access certification reviews (quarterly)
- Just-in-time access for privileged operations
- Immediate deprovisioning upon role change or termination

#### Multi-Factor Authentication

MFA is enforced for all user access to the IMS with the following implementation:

| Access Type | MFA Requirement | Exceptions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Web UI Access | Always required | None |
| API Access | Required for privileged operations | Automated system processes |
| Administrative Access | Always required with step-up authentication | Emergency break-glass procedures |
| Developer Access | Always required | None |

The MFA implementation supports:
- Push notifications to mobile devices
- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn)
- Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
- SMS as fallback only (with additional verification)

#### Session Management

The IMS implements secure session management with the following controls:

| Control | Implementation | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Session Timeout | 15 minutes of inactivity | Prevent unauthorized access to unattended sessions |
| Session Termination | Forced on password change | Invalidate sessions after credential changes |
| Concurrent Sessions | Limited to 3 per user | Prevent credential sharing |
| Session Tracking | Unique session identifiers | Enable audit and forensic capabilities |

Sessions are managed using server-side state with client-side reference tokens to prevent session hijacking. All session data is encrypted at rest and in transit.

#### Token Handling

The IMS uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with the following security controls:

| Token Type | Lifetime | Refresh Mechanism | Storage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access Token | 1 hour | Refresh token | HTTP-only secure cookies |
| Refresh Token | 8 hours | Re-authentication | Server-side with reference only to client |
| API Token | 15 minutes | Client credentials flow | Secure key vault |
| Service Token | 30 minutes | Automatic rotation | In-memory only |

All tokens implement:
- Digital signatures using RS256 (RSA Signature with SHA-256)
- Token validation on every request
- Audience and issuer validation
- Expiration time validation
- Secure storage mechanisms

#### Password Policies

The IMS enforces the following password policies:

| Policy | Requirement | Enforcement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Minimum Length | 12 characters | At creation and change |
| Complexity | Must contain 3 of 4: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols | At creation and change |
| History | No reuse of last 24 passwords | At password change |
| Maximum Age | 90 days | Forced change prompt |
| Account Lockout | 5 failed attempts | Temporary lockout with escalating duration |

Additional password security measures include:
- Password breach detection against known compromised passwords
- Risk-based authentication that considers login patterns and locations
- Secure password reset workflows with verification steps
- Password strength meters during creation

### 6.4.2 AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM

#### Role-Based Access Control

The IMS implements a comprehensive RBAC model with the following structure:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|assigned to| B[Role]
    B -->|contains| C[Permissions]
    C -->|grants access to| D[Resources]
    B -->|inherits from| E[Parent Roles]
    F[Groups] -->|contain| A
    F -->|assigned to| B
```

The core roles in the system include:

| Role Category | Example Roles | Access Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Traders | Equity Trader, Fixed Income Trader | Read inventory, submit locates |
| Operations | Inventory Manager, Locate Approver | Read/write inventory, approve locates |
| Compliance | Compliance Officer, Audit Reviewer | Read all data, view audit logs |
| Administration | System Admin, Security Admin | Configure system, manage users |

Roles are designed following the principle of least privilege, with separation of duties enforced for sensitive operations.

#### Permission Management

Permissions in the IMS are managed through a hierarchical model:

| Permission Level | Example | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| System | Configure calculation rules | Global system settings |
| Function | Approve locates | Specific business function |
| Data | View client positions | Specific data category |
| Instance | Manage specific client | Individual data record |

Permissions are assigned to roles through a matrix that defines:
- Read/write/execute access levels
- Data scope limitations (all, region, desk, client)
- Time-based restrictions (trading hours only)
- Approval requirements for sensitive operations

#### Resource Authorization

The IMS implements resource-level authorization with the following controls:

| Resource Type | Authorization Control | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| API Endpoints | Permission verification | API Gateway policy enforcement |
| UI Components | Component-level visibility | Frontend rendering rules |
| Data Objects | Row/column level security | Database and application filtering |
| Reports/Exports | Content filtering | Pre-generation authorization checks |

Resource authorization is implemented using:
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained decisions
- Context-aware authorization considering time, location, and device
- Dynamic policy evaluation for real-time permission changes
- Hierarchical resource ownership model

#### Policy Enforcement Points

The IMS implements multiple policy enforcement points to ensure comprehensive security coverage:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Client Request] --> B[API Gateway]
    B -->|Enforce authentication| C[Authentication Service]
    B -->|Enforce coarse-grained authorization| D[Authorization Service]
    B -->|Validate request| E[Backend Service]
    E -->|Enforce fine-grained authorization| F[Policy Enforcement Point]
    F -->|Check policies| G[Policy Decision Point]
    G -->|Retrieve policies| H[Policy Store]
    F -->|Allow/Deny| I[Resource Access]
    I -->|Log access| J[Audit Log]
```

Policy enforcement occurs at multiple layers:
- Network layer: Firewall rules and network segmentation
- API Gateway: Authentication and coarse-grained authorization
- Service layer: Function-level authorization
- Data layer: Row and column level security
- Client layer: UI component visibility

#### Audit Logging

The IMS implements comprehensive audit logging for security events:

| Event Category | Events Logged | Retention Period |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication | Login attempts, MFA events, password changes | 2 years |
| Authorization | Access attempts, permission changes | 7 years |
| Data Access | Read/write operations on sensitive data | 7 years |
| Configuration | System setting changes, rule modifications | 7 years |
| Administrative | User management, role assignments | 7 years |

Audit logs include:
- Timestamp with millisecond precision
- User identity and source IP
- Action performed and result
- Resource affected
- Contextual information (device, location)
- Correlation ID for request tracing

Logs are stored in a tamper-evident format with cryptographic verification to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements.

### 6.4.3 DATA PROTECTION

#### Encryption Standards

The IMS implements encryption throughout the system with the following standards:

| Data State | Encryption Standard | Key Length | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Data in Transit | TLS 1.3 | 256-bit | All network communications |
| Data at Rest | AES-256-GCM | 256-bit | Database and file storage |
| Sensitive Fields | Format-preserving encryption | 256-bit | PII and sensitive attributes |
| Backups | AES-256-CBC | 256-bit | All backup files and archives |

Additional encryption controls include:
- Perfect forward secrecy for all TLS connections
- Certificate pinning for critical connections
- Signed API payloads for high-value transactions
- Encrypted configuration files and secrets

#### Key Management

The IMS implements a comprehensive key management system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Hardware Security Module] -->|Generates| B[Root Keys]
    B -->|Derive| C[Key Encryption Keys]
    C -->|Encrypt| D[Data Encryption Keys]
    D -->|Encrypt| E[Application Data]
    
    F[Key Management Service] -->|Stores| C
    F -->|Distributes| D
    F -->|Rotates| D
    
    G[Access Control] -->|Protects| F
    H[Audit Logging] -->|Monitors| F
```

Key management practices include:
- Automated key rotation schedules (90 days for data keys, 1 year for key encryption keys)
- Key usage limitations by purpose and scope
- Secure key distribution using envelope encryption
- Key backup and recovery procedures
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for root key protection
- Separation of duties for key management operations

#### Data Masking Rules

The IMS implements data masking to protect sensitive information:

| Data Category | Masking Method | Access Control | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Client Identifiers | Partial masking | Role-based | ABC12****** |
| Position Values | Threshold-based rounding | Role-based | Values above $1M rounded to nearest $100K |
| Personal Information | Complete masking | Function-based | ******@example.com |
| Account Numbers | Last 4 digits only | Context-based | ********1234 |

Data masking is applied:
- Dynamically based on user role and context
- Consistently across all interfaces (UI, API, reports)
- With different levels based on business need
- With special handling for regulatory reporting

#### Secure Communication

The IMS implements secure communication channels for all data exchange:

| Communication Type | Security Controls | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Internal Services | Mutual TLS, Service Mesh | Istio with mTLS enforcement |
| External APIs | TLS 1.3, API Keys, OAuth 2.0 | API Gateway with certificate validation |
| File Transfers | SFTP with key authentication | Automated key rotation |
| Database Connections | TLS, Certificate Authentication | Connection pooling with TLS |

Additional communication security measures include:
- Network segmentation with security zones
- Traffic filtering at multiple layers
- Deep packet inspection for sensitive data flows
- API payload encryption for highly sensitive data

#### Compliance Controls

The IMS implements controls to meet regulatory requirements across global jurisdictions:

| Regulation | Control Category | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GDPR | Data Protection | Consent management, data minimization, right to be forgotten |
| SOX | Financial Controls | Segregation of duties, audit trails, change management |
| PCI DSS | Cardholder Data | Tokenization, scope minimization, access controls |
| Regional Securities Regulations | Trading Controls | Market-specific rules, audit logging, reporting |

Compliance is maintained through:
- Regular compliance assessments and audits
- Automated compliance checking in CI/CD pipeline
- Regulatory change monitoring and implementation
- Comprehensive documentation and evidence collection
- Segregation of duties for critical functions

### 6.4.4 SECURITY ZONES

The IMS implements a defense-in-depth approach with multiple security zones:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "External Zone"
        A[Internet]
        B[Partner Networks]
    end
    
    subgraph "DMZ"
        C[Load Balancers]
        D[WAF]
        E[API Gateway]
    end
    
    subgraph "Application Zone"
        F[Web Servers]
        G[API Services]
        H[Processing Services]
    end
    
    subgraph "Data Zone"
        I[Database Servers]
        J[Message Queues]
        K[Cache Services]
    end
    
    subgraph "Management Zone"
        L[Admin Workstations]
        M[Monitoring Systems]
        N[Security Tools]
    end
    
    A --> C
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    E --> G
    F --> G
    G --> H
    G --> J
    H --> I
    H --> J
    H --> K
    L --> M
    M --> F
    M --> G
    M --> H
    M --> I
    N --> D
    N --> E
    N --> M
```

Zone-based security controls include:
- Strict network ACLs between zones
- Traffic filtering based on protocol and port
- Stateful inspection of all cross-zone traffic
- Micro-segmentation within zones
- Bastion hosts for administrative access
- Jump servers for cross-zone management

### 6.4.5 SECURITY MONITORING AND RESPONSE

The IMS implements comprehensive security monitoring:

| Monitoring Type | Tools | Detection Capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |

        IR->>IR: Containment Actions
        IR->>Business: Notification
        IR->>IR: Investigation
        IR->>IR: Remediation
        IR->>Business: Resolution Report
        IR->>SIEM: Update Incident Record
    end
```

### 6.4.6 SECURITY COMPLIANCE MATRIX

| Security Control | Implementation | Compliance Requirement | Verification Method |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Access Control | RBAC + ABAC | SOX, GDPR, ISO 27001 | Quarterly access review |

## 6.6 TESTING STRATEGY

### 6.6.1 TESTING APPROACH

#### Unit Testing

| Aspect | Description | Tools/Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Testing Frameworks | Primary frameworks for component-level testing | JUnit 5 for Java services<br>Jest for JavaScript/TypeScript<br>ScalaTest for Scala components |
| Test Organization | Structure for organizing test code | Mirror production package structure<br>Test classes named with `*Test` suffix<br>Group tests by component functionality |
| Mocking Strategy | Approach for isolating components during testing | Mockito for Java services<br>Jest mocks for JavaScript<br>TestContainers for database dependencies<br>WireMock for external API dependencies |
| Code Coverage | Minimum coverage requirements | 85% line coverage for business logic<br>70% line coverage for infrastructure code<br>100% coverage for critical calculation components |

The unit testing approach will focus on thorough testing of all calculation components, with particular emphasis on the core inventory calculation logic. Given the financial nature of the system and regulatory requirements, all calculation components must have comprehensive test suites that verify correctness under various scenarios.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Write Test] --> B{Does it test<br>a single unit?}
    B -->|No| C[Refactor Test]
    B -->|Yes| D{Are all dependencies<br>properly mocked?}
    D -->|No| E[Add Mocks]
    D -->|Yes| F{Does it cover<br>edge cases?}
    F -->|No| G[Add Edge Cases]
    F -->|Yes| H[Run Test]
    H --> I{Test Passes?}
    I -->|No| J[Fix Code or Test]
    I -->|Yes| K[Measure Coverage]
    K --> L{Meets Coverage<br>Requirements?}
    L -->|No| M[Add Tests]
    L -->|Yes| N[Commit Code]
```

For calculation components, we will implement property-based testing using tools like jqwik (Java) or fast-check (TypeScript) to verify mathematical properties and invariants across a wide range of inputs.

#### Integration Testing

| Aspect | Description | Tools/Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Service Integration | Testing interaction between services | Spring Boot Test for Java services<br>TestContainers for database integration<br>Kafka Test Utils for message testing |

### 6.6.5 SPECIALIZED TESTING APPROACHES

#### Performance Testing Strategy

Given the high-throughput requirements (300,000+ events per second) and strict latency requirements (<200ms end-to-end, <150ms for short sell approval), a comprehensive performance testing strategy is essential:

1. **Component-Level Performance Testing**:
   - Microbenchmarking of critical calculation components
   - Memory usage profiling for data-intensive operations
   - Garbage collection optimization

2. **Service-Level Load Testing**:
   - Simulated load testing with realistic data volumes
   - Sustained throughput testing at expected peak loads
   - Burst testing at 2-3x expected peak loads

3. **End-to-End Performance Testing**:
   - Full system testing with simulated market data feeds
   - Latency measurement across all critical paths
   - Resource utilization monitoring during peak loads

4. **Performance Regression Testing**:
   - Automated performance tests in CI/CD pipeline
   - Historical performance trend analysis
   - Alerting on performance degradation

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Define Performance Requirements] --> B[Identify Critical Paths]
    B --> C[Design Performance Tests]

    F --> G{Meets Requirements?}
    G -->|No| H[Optimize System]
    H --> E
    G -->|Yes| I[Implement Regression Tests]
    I --> J[Monitor Performance Trends]
```

#### Security Testing Strategy

Security testing will focus on protecting sensitive financial data and ensuring regulatory compliance:

1. **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**:
   - Automated code scanning for security vulnerabilities
   - Dependency analysis for known vulnerabilities
   - Secure coding practice enforcement

2. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**:
   - Web application vulnerability scanning
   - API security testing
   - Authentication and authorization testing

3. **Infrastructure Security Testing**:
   - Network security scanning
   - Container security analysis
   - Cloud configuration review

4. **Manual Security Testing**:
   - Penetration testing by security specialists
   - Security code reviews
   - Threat modeling sessions

#### Data Quality Testing

Given the critical nature of financial calculations, data quality testing is essential:

1. **Reference Data Validation**:
   - Schema validation for all incoming data
   - Business rule validation for reference data
   - Reconciliation testing for batch loads

2. **Calculation Validation**:
   - Known-result testing with pre-calculated examples
   - Boundary condition testing for all calculations
   - Consistency testing across different calculation methods

3. **Data Integrity Testing**:
   - Transaction integrity under failure conditions
   - Data consistency across distributed components
   - Recovery testing from data corruption scenarios

### 6.6.6 TEST DATA MANAGEMENT

| Aspect | Strategy | Implementation |
